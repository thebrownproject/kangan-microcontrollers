    "## MQTT with MicroPython\n",
    "\n",
    "**MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)** is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for devices to communicate efficiently with each other, especially when the network is slow, unreliable, or bandwidth-limited.\n",
    "It’s one of the most popular protocols used in the Internet of Things (IoT) because it enables sensors, microcontrollers, and applications to send and receive messages easily.\n",

    "HiveMQ provides a free cloud-based broker that’s secure, reliable, and ideal for small IoT projects. Unlike running a broker locally (like Mosquitto), HiveMQ Cloud takes care of hosting and TLS security for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Create a HiveMQ Cloud Account**\n",
    "1. Go to HiveMQ Cloud\n",
    "2. Click **Sign Up** and create a free account (choose the free tier plan).\n",
    "3. Confirm your email and log in to the HiveMQ Cloud Console.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Step 2: Create a Cluster (Your Broker)**\n",
    "1. Once logged in, click **Create Cluster**.\n",
    "2. Choose:\n",
    "    - Region: (e.g., Europe or US – closer region = faster connection).\n",
    "    - Tier: Select Free.\n",
    "3. HiveMQ will set up your cluster (broker) (e.g., `xxxx.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Step 3: Create MQTT Credentials**\n",
    "1. In the cluster settings, go to Access Management → MQTT Clients.\n",

    "    - **Password**: `StrongPassword123!` (use something strong).\n",
    "4. Save – you’ll use these in your Pico W code to connect securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Step 4: Enable TLS (Secure Communication)**\n",
    "HiveMQ Cloud requires TLS/SSL encryption on port 8883.\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- You must connect using port 8883 (not 1883).\n",
    "- In MicroPython, the `umqtt.simple` library supports SSL with a little extra setup.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**TLS = Transport Layer Security.**\n",
    "It ensures communication between your device and HiveMQ is:\n",
    "- Encrypted → outsiders can’t read it.\n",
    "- Authenticated → your Pico knows it’s talking to HiveMQ (not a fake broker).\n",
    "- Tamper-proof → messages can’t be changed secretly on the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "TLS is like the **padlock icon**  you see in your web browser with `https://`.\n",
